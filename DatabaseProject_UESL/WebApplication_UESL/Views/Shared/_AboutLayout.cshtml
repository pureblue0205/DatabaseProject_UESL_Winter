        <p>
            The University English as a Second Language (UESL) program acts as an

            intermediary between Central Washington University (CWU) international

            students and the registrar. The department is tasked with gathering student

            information; such as place of origin, visa records and class enrollment

            information. For example, once a student has chosen their courses, then a

            course plan is sent from UESL to the registrar; this then allows the student to

            enroll in classes for the quarter.
        </p>

        <p>
            As of now, the UESL department keeps all of their student’s information in

            multiple Microsoft Excel spread sheets (see appendix, problem example). They

            then print out the class information on a separate sheet and give a physical copy

            to the registrar. To simplify this processes, using Microsoft SQL Server Express

            and the C# programming language, we have developed a portable database that

            easily exports to Excel. The interface is available as a user friendly web-

            application, developed using model view controller (MVC) and the ASP.NET

            framework. This allows the UESL department to query their database of

            students based on a variety of search parameters, including; student name,

            CWU ID number, class, or professor.
        </p>

        <p>
            To meet the needs of the UESL department, we have developed a dynamic

            program utilizing C#, Microsoft SQL Server Express, and the Microsoft .NET

            framework. We have utilized the C# programing language to develop the database

            and functions for exporting Microsoft Excel files of stored student and course

            data. The use of Microsoft’s SQL Server Express, a free program, improves

            the portability of the database. This makes it perfect for developing a compact

            program that employs important database functions while increasing ease of

            use. Finally, access of the data stored in the database will be achieved

            through the use of a model view controller (MVC) web-application and Microsoft’s

            Entity Framework.
